In the African savannah, lions are apex predators that hunt zebras and antelopes for food. Zebras graze on the grasses that dominate the savannah landscape, helping maintain the balance of the ecosystem by preventing overgrowth. Elephants, known for their large size, play a critical role by uprooting trees and shrubs, which in turn promotes grass growth and creates open spaces for other animals. Vultures often scavenge the remains of animals that predators, such as lions and hyenas, leave behind, completing the food chain. Waterholes are vital for all animals, including giraffes, which rely on these scarce resources for hydration. The interconnected relationships between these animals and their environment maintain the delicate balance of the savannah ecosystem.
